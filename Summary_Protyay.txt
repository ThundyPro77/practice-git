Summary of the OSP's by Protyay Mondal LIT51:

You should have a good reason behind contributing to open source projects,even if those are self-serving ones.Neverthless,you are learning
something from it and that is what is required.

Have a kind tone, avoid using foul language while communicating.You should maintain a level of decency with the persons having greater knolwdge and experience than you.

Do not discriminate ,try to be open-minded towards other contributors.

Do not just unnecessarily contribute, you should think twice whether or not your contribution is effective or not.if you have self-doubts,
ask other contributors / yourmentors.

Always read the manual yourself before asking doubts.

Ask one question on a topic at a time, without making your conversation chaotic.

Remember OSP's  are democratic, and the decisions maybe  voted out, and which could  any time  go against  your opinion.


Other things that have not been mentioned in the article:
1) Always try your best to contribute to a liitle better issues, even if they feel overwhelming.Only practice hands on can make you better.
2)When stuck, you can always ask your peers about it.Sometimes mentors or even other contributors may be busy.
3)Do not panic if you are not being able to solve issues,try gaining more knowlwdge on the topics, once even an expert was a beginner.
